# Named Entity WordCount Analysis using Databricks

Developed a Named Entity Recognition (NER) WordCount Pipeline using PySpark and NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK) on Databricks, analyzing large text files sourced from the Gutenberg Project.

Implemented MapReduce operations to extract named entities and perform word frequency analysis, generating a descending order list of the most frequently occurring named entities.

Optimized the ETL process by integrating NLP libraries for entity extraction, enabling accurate identification and categorization of entities in large-scale text data.
